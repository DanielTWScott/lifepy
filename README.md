## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- ImageMagick if you want to use `matplotlib` to make a gif

### Installing
- Clone this repository if you want to - I've only tested this on my machine with Anaconda Python

View interactive matplotlib

```sh
python life.py gosper
```

use the `--make-gif` flag to save to a .gif.

View the notebook with Jupyter Lab.
